# Customer Churn Analysis and Revenue Impact Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior for a telecom company to identify churn drivers, quantify revenue loss, and highlight high-risk customer segments. The goal is to support data-driven retention strategies by combining data analytics with clear business storytelling.

## Business Objectives
- Measure overall customer churn and revenue impact
- Identify key behavioral and demographic churn drivers
- Segment customers by value and tenure to assess risk
- Recommend actionable retention strategies based on insights

## Dataset
- Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset
- Records: 7,043 customers
- Features include tenure, contract type, payment method, charges, and churn status

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data cleaning and feature engineering
- PostgreSQL for analytical SQL queries and business insights
- Power BI for data visualization and storytelling

## Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing in Python
2. Feature engineering including tenure groups and customer value segmentation
3. Business-driven SQL analysis to calculate churn metrics and revenue loss
4. Power BI dashboard creation with three analytical views

## Dashboard Structure
### Page 1: Executive Overview
- Overall churn rate and customer distribution
- Total revenue lost due to churn
- Churn trends across customer tenure

### Page 2: Churn Drivers
- Churn by contract type and payment method
- Churn across customer value segments
- Comparison of behavioral vs demographic churn factors

### Page 3: Revenue & Risk Segments
- Revenue loss by customer value
- High-risk customer segments using tenure, contract, and payment behavior
- Actionable recommendations for retention

## Key Insights
- Churn is highest among early-tenure customers
- Month-to-month contracts and manual or electronic payment methods drive higher churn
- High-value customer churn causes disproportionate revenue loss
- Retention efforts should prioritize early-tenure and high-value customers

## Recommendations
- Incentivize long-term contracts
- Promote automatic payment methods
- Focus retention programs on high-value customer segments
- Improve onboarding and engagement during early customer lifecycle

## Outcome
The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow from raw data to executive-level insights, combining Python, SQL, and Power BI to support business decision-making.
